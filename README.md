This is a weather application that uses weatherApi to show user weather for the current location

## Getting Started

First, we need our api key:
Go to the weatherApi website
Register
Receive your api code
Create an .env.local file and insert there 
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
```
Than, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
